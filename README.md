# Assignment: Practicing the Process API
Practicing with fork, exec, wait. 

### Overview

In this assignment, you will practice using the Process API to create processes and run programs under Linux. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with system calls related to process management. Specifically, you will practice using the unix process API functions 'fork()', 'exec()', 'wait()', and 'exit()'. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is not an OS/161 assignment. You will complete it directly on Linux. 

Use the Linux in your CSE4001 container. If you are using macOS, you may use the Terminal (you may need to install development tools with C/C++ compilers).

### Questions
1. Write a program that calls `fork()`. Before calling `fork()`, have the main process access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to something (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?


```cpp
The initial value of the variable is 100, and in the child process it adds 50, meaning that the final process is 150. After the fork, the child gets a copy of the parents memory, so the change in one process doesn't change the other, meaning the child and parent process can have different values.
```


2. Write a program that opens a file (with the `open()` system call) and then calls `fork()` to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by `open()`? What happens when they are writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same time?

```cpp
Both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by open(). If the fork is called after the open file description is created, both the parent and child will be sharing the same open file. If they write at the same time, they can interleave at the byte level or overlap, depending on the timing, causing incorrect text.
```

3. Write another program using `fork()`.The child process should print ‚Äúhello‚Äù; the parent process should print ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù. You should try to ensure that the child process always prints first; can you do this without calling `wait()` in the parent?

```cpp
Using pipe ensures that the child can connect with the parent, so the parent waits for the childs signal before printing.  
```


4. Write a program that calls `fork()` and then calls some form of `exec()` to run the program `/bin/ls`. See if you can try all of the variants of `exec()`, including (on Linux) `execl()`, `execle()`, `execlp()`, `execv()`, `execvp()`, and `execvpe()`. Why do you think there are so many variants of the same basic call?

```cpp
The exec() call that should be used depends on the case. Some of them are prefereably to search for paths, while others are better to simulate different environments. 
```

5. Now write a program that uses `wait()` to wait for the child process to finish in the parent. What does `wait()` return? What happens if you use `wait()` in the child?

```cpp
 The wait() command is important because it doesn't matter if the parent runs first, it will wait for the child to finish running, then wait() returns and the parent prints the message. If wait() is inside the child process, it will fail because the child doesn't have a child of its own to wait for.
```

6. Write a slight modification of the previous program, this time using `waitpid()` instead of `wait()`. When would `waitpid()` be useful?

```cpp
waitpid() will be more useful if the parent wants to wait for a specific child, (like if there is more then 1 child), and it will also give the exit status of the child.  
```

7. Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the child closes standard output (`STDOUT FILENO`). What happens if the child calls `printf()` to print some output after closing the descriptor?

```cpp
calling STDOUT() frees up the descriptor and therefore the child wont be able to print anything on the terminal after the descriptor closes.
```
